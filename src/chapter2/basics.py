# Follow each of the TODO COMMENTs in this file.

# Variables
# Below, we have a VARIABLE which is like a symbol that represents a value. You can assign a value to a VARIABLE using the '=' sign.
# In code, we use quotes to represent text, and we call this a STRING.
# TODO: Uncomment the line below. You can do this by removing the `#`. Next, assign your name to the `name` VARIABLE, enclosed in quotes. 
# name = 

# TODO: Pass in the `name` VARIABLE to the `print` FUNCTION to print your name. We can pass VARIABLES as ARGUMENTS to FUNCTIONS.
# print(PUT_NAME_HERE)

# TODO: In your TERMINAL, run the command `python src/chapter2/basics.py` You should see your name on the TERMINAL window.
# Notice how we give the path of the `basics.py` file to run. If in your TERMINAL you are running from a different location, we would need to provide a different path.

# TODO: Assign your favorite number to the `favorite_number` VARIABLE. This time, you don't need to use quotes because numbers are not text.
# favorite_number = 

# TODO: Assign another number to the `another_number` VARIABLE.
# another_number = 

# TODO Uncomment the line below.
# print(favorite_number + another_number)

# TODO: In your TERMINAL, run the command `python src/chapter2/basics.py`. You should now also see the sum of your favorite number and another number.

# TODO BONUS: How would you print the result of favorite_number * another_number?
# print(YOUR_ANSWER_HERE)
